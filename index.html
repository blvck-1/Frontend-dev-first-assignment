    <p>JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language that is primarily associated with web development. Its history can be traced back to the early 1990s when the World Wide Web was in its infancy. At that time, the web was primarily static, consisting of simple text and images. There was a need for a way to make web pages more interactive and dynamic, and this led to the creation of JavaScript.

      In 1995, Netscape Communications Corporation, a prominent web browser company at the time, developed and introduced JavaScript as part of their Netscape Navigator browser. Initially, JavaScript was designed for simple tasks like form validation and interactivity. It allowed web developers to add scripts directly into HTML pages to manipulate elements on the page, respond to user actions, and perform basic data processing.
      
      Soon after, Microsoft introduced a similar scripting language called JScript in their Internet Explorer browser. However, to standardize these scripting languages and avoid fragmentation, efforts were made to create a common standard. This led to the formation of the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and the eventual release of the ECMAScript specification. ECMAScript is the standardized scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript.
      
      JavaScript's popularity continued to grow rapidly as more interactive and dynamic web applications were developed. The introduction of technologies like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) further enhanced its capabilities, enabling seamless data exchange between the browser and the server without requiring a full page reload. This was a pivotal moment in web development, as it laid the groundwork for the modern web applications we see today.</p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">
console.log("Hello, World!");
        </code>
    </pre>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.28.0/prism.min.js"></script>

      <li><b>Client-Side Interactivity:</b> JavaScript allows developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can manipulate HTML elements, handle user events (such as clicks and input), and update content without requiring a full page reload, providing a smoother user experience.</li>
      <li><b>Compatibility:</b> JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a cross-platform language that can run on various devices and operating systems.</li>
      <li><b>Community and Resources:</b> JavaScript has a vast and active developer community, which has led to the creation of numerous libraries, frameworks, and tools. Popular libraries like jQuery, frameworks like React and Angular, and build tools like webpack have all contributed to making JavaScript development more efficient and accessible.</li>
      <li><b>Server-Side Development:</b> With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used for server-side scripting, enabling developers to build scalable and efficient server applications using a single programming language.</li>
      <li><b>Rapid Development:</b> JavaScript's relatively simple syntax and dynamic nature allow developers to quickly prototype and build applications. This can lead to faster development cycles and quicker time-to-market.</li>
      <li><b>Ecosystem and Package Management:</b> JavaScript benefits from a robust ecosystem of packages and modules that can be easily managed using tools like npm (Node Package Manager). This makes it easier to incorporate third-party functionality into projects.</li>
      <li><b>Rich User Interfaces:</b> JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular have enabled the creation of complex and feature-rich user interfaces, helping developers build modern, interactive web applications.</li>
